# alleaffengaffen.ch

A website interesting for monkeys.

## What does alleaffengaffen mean?

It's a german word-play, merging the words "all", "monkeys" and "gwap" together. It can't be translated to English as all.

I found the domain by chance when It just got released again. Since it was funny name I thought I'll do some over-engineering with it because we can.
