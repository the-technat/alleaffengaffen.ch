# alleaffengaffen.ch

A website interesting for monkeys.

## What does alleaffengaffen mean?

It's a german word-play, merging the words "all", "monkeys" and "gwap" together. It can't be translated to English as all.

I found the domain by chance when It just got released again. Since it was funny name I thought I'll do some over-engineering with it because we can.

There's a container image available serving the static wesite on port `8080`: `ghcr.io/the-technat/alleaffengaffen.ch:latest`

It should work with almost all security best-practices/restrictions. I mainly use it as demo-app.
